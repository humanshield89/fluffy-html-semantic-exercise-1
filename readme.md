# Html Semantic Exercise

These are some basic exercises destined for beginner students who only know HTML so far. The goal is to give these HTML files to the students, and they try to the best of their knowledge to make those pages follow proper HTML semantics by renaming and adding the proper semantic tags

## Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Cloning a repository will download the source code to your local machine.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:humanshield89/html-semantic-exercise-1.git
```

### 2. Open the files in VSCode

Open the files in VSCode and try to make the pages follow proper HTML semantics by renaming and adding the proper semantic tags. In order to open the files in VSCode, you can either:

- Open VSCode and drag the files into the editor
- Open VSCode, click on File > Open and select the folder where the files are located.
- Right-click on the folder where the files are located, and select "Open with Code"
- Run the command `code [PATH_TO_REPOSITORY]` in the terminal

### 3. Open the files in the browser

Open the files in the browser to see what they look like. To open the files in the browser, you can Right-click on the `html` file and select "Open with Live Server"

### 4. Check the solution

Once you are done, you can check the solution by opening the `solution` folder and opening the files in the browser (No peeking! ðŸ˜œ)

### 5. Rules of the Exercise

- Do not change the content of the pages
- Do not look at the solution before you are done
- You can use any resource you want to help you (Google, [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) etc.)
